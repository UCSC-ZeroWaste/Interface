    text: "Single use plastics are one of your greatest enemies! One of the easiest practices to adopt is to replace plastic bottled drinks, especially bottled water, with your own beloved reusable bottle. Get yourself a beautiful high quality reusable bottle and fill it up with water and take it with you everytime you leave the house. Next time you leave the house, check “Keys, phone, wallet, WATER BOTTLE!",

    text: "Get yourself a reusable coffee mug and quit accepting disposable paper cups at coffee shops. Reusable mugs are superior. They keep the heat in and they seal properly so you don’t need to worry about spills or leaks.  They can last indefinitely and many coffee shops offer a discount on your beverage when you use it!",

    title: "Compost for the climate",
    text: "Did you know that food waste makes up the largest portion of landfill? Organic matter (like food waste) releases methane gas when it is stored in low oxygen environments like landfills. Eighteen percent of America’s methane emissions come from landfills.12 This is bad because methane contributes 28 percent of the global warming we are experiencing and the amount of methane in the atmosphere has doubled in the last 100 years.12 This means that composting is a serious issue for climate change! When food waste is allowed to naturally decompose in an open air compost, doesn’t release methane and turns into nutrient dense, carbon rich soil. In addition to preventing methane production, composting will capture all those minerals and carbon that get absorbed from the soil by crops, and return it back into the soil. Think of food scraps like a multivitamin for soil. The last place we want compost is in the landfill!",

    title: "Take a container for your take out",
    text: "Next time you go out to eat, or order take-out, bring your own container to the restaurant and ask the food server to kindly put the food in your own container. Try to ‘eat in’ at restaurants whenever you can if you don’t have a container with you in order to avoid the dreaded excess take-out packaging. Be sure to use your own containers to take home your leftovers too. It only feels weird to ask the server the first time you do it!",

You might also like glass or stainless steel straws as well. Be careful to refuse plastic straws at restaurants and bars.",

There is a smorgasbord of these bars available and they are not expensive at all. The ingredients in shampoo bars are really simple: olive oil, coconut oil, castor oil, sodium hydroxide, and pure essential oils for fragrance.",

    text: "Give your old clothes away to people, not landfills. To make sure that your old clothes never hit the landfill, donate or resell them. Find your local Goodwill bin and never let a textile hit the trash again. You can always sell your own high quality clothes online too. There are many cool web apps specialising in reselling of pre-loved clothes.",

They work just as well as plastic toothbrushes, but they do wear out a little sooner. You can get them from Wholefoods or purchase them online. But make sure you actually do compost them after they have worn out!",

Choose fun things to do like hiking, singing, playing a musical instrument, gardening, yoga, dance class, writing romantic poetry, or seeing a live music show. Avoid going shopping at malls or just buying things for fun. Websites like Groupon, Livingsocial, and Meetup.com have activities in your area (like kayaking or massage) that you might not usually think of doing.",

Keep a box or jar of cloth squares that can be used to replace paper towels. Keep another container to put the used towels in so that everything is nicely organised.",
